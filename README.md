# OpenAI API Example Usage

This is a collection of example projects in NodeJS that makes use of the OpenAI API. This project includes example code that uses AI to generate RPG characters, including interesting personalities, story backgrounds, and a generated portait to with it.

You will need to create an [API Key on the OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) before continuing. The free trial currently includes $18 in credits.

There is [an example of this project deployed to AWS Lambda]( https://4l8lmpmgh9.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/character-generator).

Beware keeping secrets there.

## Install and Run

1. Clone this repo (if you didn't use the Gitpod IDE option)

    $ cd openapi-examples
    ```

2. Install the requirements

   ```bash

   ```

3. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   On Linux systems: 
   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```
   On Windows:
